# What are idioms

**Idioms** are phrases that have a *figurative meaning* that is different from the *literal meaning* of the individual words. All languages have their own idioms to express a situation.

- **Literal meaning:** The actual, dictionary definition of each word.
- **Figurative meaning:** The implied or metaphorical meaning of the phrase as a whole.

`"lt's raining cats and dogs"`

- **Literal meaning:** Animals are falling from the sky! (Obviously not true)
- **Figurative meaning:** lt's raining very heavily or in certain scenarios raining all day.

# The difference between slang and idioms
- **Slang:** Informal words or phrases used by a specific group (teenagers, gamers, etc.). - *Cool words that change a lot, used bycertain groups.*
  - **Examples:**  *Chill*, *lit*, *bruh*
  - **Key:**  Often changes quickly and is specific to a certain group.
- **Idioms:**  *Phrases with hidden meanings, like puzzles you have to figure out.*
